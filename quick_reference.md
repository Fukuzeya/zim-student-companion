## For Students

### How do I start?
1. Save +263 XX XXX XXXX to your phone
2. Open WhatsApp and send "Hi"
3. Follow the setup prompts (takes 2 minutes)
4. Start practicing!

### Why doesn't it just give me the answer?
Our AI uses the "Socratic Method" - asking guiding questions that help you discover answers yourself. This builds real understanding that helps in exams, not just copying answers.

### What are XP points?
XP (Experience Points) are rewards for learning. Earn XP by answering correctly, maintaining streaks, and joining competitions. More XP = higher levels and badges!

### How do streaks work?
Practice at least once per day to build a streak. Longer streaks earn bonus rewards. Miss a day and your streak resets to zero.

### Can I use it for homework?
Yes! Type "ask" followed by your question, and the AI will help guide you to the answer.

### What if I'm stuck on a question?
Type "hint" to get a clue. You get 3 hints per question. Hints help point you in the right direction without giving away the answer.

## For Parents

### How do I monitor my child's progress?
1. Ask your child to type "parent code" in their chat
2. They'll receive a 6-digit code

### What information will I see?
- Questions attempted and accuracy
- Time spent studying
- Subjects practiced
- Strengths and areas needing work
- Streak status and achievements

### Can I see what questions my child is asking?
For privacy, you see summary statistics, not individual conversations. This encourages honest learning while keeping you informed.
