### ❓ Asking Questions

The AI tutor uses the **Socratic Method** - it guides you to discover answers yourself rather than just telling you.

#### Example:
```
You: How do plants make food?

Bot: Great question! 🌱 Let's explore this together.
     
     First, think about what plants need to survive.
     What do you see plants doing during the day
     that they don't do at night?

You: They need sunlight?

Bot: Exactly! 🌟 Sunlight is essential.
     
     Now, plants also take in something from the air
     through tiny holes in their leaves. 
     Do you know what gas that might be?

You: Carbon dioxide?

Bot: Perfect! You're discovering photosynthesis! 🎉
     
     So plants use sunlight + carbon dioxide + water
     to make their own food (glucose) and release oxygen.
     
     This is called PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
     
     Want me to explain the chemical equation?
```
